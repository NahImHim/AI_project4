Special Directions (if any):
- Rubberbanding uses forward sweep algorithm starting from goal and working backwards
- Smoothing + Rubberbanding combination uses apply_smooth_rubberband() function
- Area checking uses 3-point bounding box to detect walls that could interfere with diagonal movement

Missing features (if any):
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm (not implemented)
- Goal bounding (not implemented)

My experience working on this project:
This project was challenging but rewarding. The most difficult part was getting the rubberbanding algorithm to work correctly, especially handling the area checking for diagonal paths between walls. I learned a lot about pathfinding optimization techniques and the importance of proper collision detection. The Catmull-Rom spline implementation was interesting to work with, and combining it with rubberbanding required careful coordination. Debugging the forward vs backward sweep approaches helped me understand the algorithm's logic better.

Extra credits:
- None attempted (Floyd-Warshall and Goal Bounding return false)
